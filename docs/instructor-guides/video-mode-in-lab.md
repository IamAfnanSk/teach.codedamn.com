# Video mode

You can create a lab alongside a video. This is best suited if you want explanation videos to go alongside hands-on practice in a single interface. Learners can minimize/hide your video any time they want, practice through playgrounds, and pop it right back if they wish to continue watching.

Take a look at how this lab would be rendered:

-   The video window you see is floating.
-   It can be adjusted and dragged anywhere by the user.
-   It can be maximized anytime by the user.

## Setting up

Setting up video mode is easy.

-   The first thing you have to do is setup a regular lab. [Check out setting up regular lab documentation first](/docs/technologies/) (depends on what lab you are setting up).

-   Once you setup a lab, go to `Lab Defaults` tab inside lab editor and click on Link Video.

-   Video Library popup would open. If you do not have existing video uploaded you want to link it with, you can upload the video for processing from `Upload Video(s)` button on top right.

:::info
If you upload fresh set of videos, it might take all of them up to 1 hour for it to process and be ready for linking.

-   Once you link your video, save your lab. You're ready to go.
