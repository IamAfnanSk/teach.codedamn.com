Next step is to setup challenges and evaluation for your lab. This is the part where your learners can learn the most because they will have to pass certain challenges.

:::tip
It is highly recommended for you to watch the video below to understand the architecture

<div
	style={{
		position: 'relative',
		width: '100%',
		height: 0,
		paddingTop: '56.25%',
	}}
>
	<iframe
		src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXep-fuTtmk?list=PLYxzS__5yYQnoUg4MCS2sew_tOZsgrUeH"
		title="YouTube video player"
		frameborder="0"
		style={{
			position: 'absolute',
			top: 0,
			left: 0,
			width: '100%',
			height: '100%',
		}}
		allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
		allowfullscreen
	></iframe>
</div>

This is the biggest advantage of using codedamn for hosting your course too - to make them truly interactive and hands-on for your users.

Let's start by setting up challenges.

The interface above can be used to add challenges to your lab. You can also add hints to every single challenge you put here.

:::tip
When the user runs the lab but fails a few challenges, the hint for that particular failed challenge is displayed to the user.
