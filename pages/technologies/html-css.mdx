# How to create an interactive HTML/CSS lab?

We'll divide this part into 3 sections:

1. Creating lab metadata
2. Setting up evaluation script and lab challenges
3. Setting up test file

## Introduction

This guide would assume that you already have created an interactive course from your instructor panel. If not, go here and set it up first: [https://codedamn.com/instructor/interactive-courses](https://codedamn.com/instructor/interactive-courses)

## Creating lab metadata

-   Add a new item lab in your course curriculum page

-   Initially, it will be blank for you. In order to create a new lab, you can click on "Create New Lab" button inside this modal. Once done, it should open the following view:

This is where you will add metadata to your labs and setup your labs for evaluation. Let's take a look at all the tabs here.

### Lab Details

Lab details is the tab where you add two important things:

-   Lab title
-   Lab description

Once both of them are filled and the lab is created, it would appear as following:
