## Instructor Account

The first step before creating an interactive course is to setup an instructor account on codedamn. Instructor account requires you to sign up for a free codedamn account in the first place. If you don't have a free codedamn account, you can go to [the registration page](https://codedamn.com/register) and create an account for yourself.

Once the account is created, you'll see the following interface on the [user dashboard](https://codedamn.com/dashboard):

This is the user dashboard. To switch to instructor dashboard, click on the user profile icon on top right:

You should now be inside instructor dashboard:
