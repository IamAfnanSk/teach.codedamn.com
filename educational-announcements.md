# Educational Announcements: Rules and Guidelines

On codedamn, instructors can use educational announcements to send upto 4 emails per month to students enrolled in your courses.

While instructors can include links to free, relevant educational content, it should not be used for any kind of marketing or promotions.

## Detailed Guidelines

-   You shall send only four educational announcements per course per month to students enrolled in the course.
-   You shall only include information relevant to your course topic.
-   You shall include educational external links, as long as it doesn’t require students to provide personal information to you, the instructor. Linking to reputable third party sites that keep student information secure (e.g., Amazon, or sites that require signing up through Google, Twitter etc.) are allowed. If there is a link that you’re unsure about using, send us an email to support@codedamn.com, and we’ll be happy to look into it.
-   You shall not include links or references to paid content off Codedamn.
-   You shall not include links or references to any sites that request money or personal information from students.
-   You shall not include links or references to affiliate links.
-   You shall not ask for or post personal information about students.

## Violations

We understand that everyone makes mistakes, and sometimes, you just don’t know what the rules are.

If an instructor does have a policy violation, they will first receive a simple warning. We will also provide resources to help better understand our policies and be successful.

If we see further violations of any of our policies, there will be more severe consequences in the form of “strikes.” The escalation process is as follows:

-   Warning → An email about the violation and our policies
-   Strike 1 → Suspension of announcements for a month
-   Strike 2 → Courses blocked from active promotions for a month + suspension of announcement and direct messaging privileges for a month
-   Strike 3 → Courses blocked from new enrollments for a month + suspension of announcement and direct messaging privileges for a month
-   Ban → Account and course materials are permanently banned from the platform

These strikes apply at a course level. Please note that we reserve the right to escalate strikes based on the severity of the violation as well as past instructor behavior. Strikes are reevaluated on a six-month rolling basis, but those with an ongoing history of policy violations will ultimately face removal from the Codedamn platform.

If you ever have questions about our policies, please let us know at support@codedamn.com.
