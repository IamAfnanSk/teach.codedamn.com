## Tip 2 - Make use of course announcements

If you already have a course published on the platform, it might be a good idea to let your older audience know about your new course. You can go on your course announcement tab inside your [interactive course mananger](https://codedamn.com/instructor/interactive-courses).

This can help you:

-   Transfer existing students on new course
-   Help them upsell your new course

Additionally, you can create a coupon for your existing audience to provide them a small discount. This would further incentivize them to go forward with your course.

## Tip 3 - Share discounted price

People love discounts. You can also offer your course on a discounted price through coupons. You can generate coupons inside your [interactive course mananger](https://codedamn.com/instructor/interactive-courses).

Once generated, you can share the link with your audience through social media:

-   YouTube (recommended)
-   Twitter
-   LinkedIn
-   Instagram
-   Facebook

You can generate discounts from 0-100%. All the discounts applied automatically work on all currencies, and provide a seamless checkout experience to the users.

## Tip 4 - Affiliate marketing

If you know people who can promote your course, you can refer them to [codedamn partner program](https://partner.codedamn.com). The partner program can help them sell your course to a wider audience and also earn while selling your courses. It is a win-win for you both: you get more sales, and your affiliate partner earns a commission on every sale.
